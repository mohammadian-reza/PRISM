# Hotspot
In this protocol, we use the HotPoint web server48 to predict hot spots in template protein interfaces, which is freely available to all users. HotPoint labels a residue as a hot spot if it is buried (its relative accessibility is less than 20%, as determined by Naccess) and its total contact potential (with respect to its neighbors within a radius of 7.0 Å) is large (more than 18.0).

# STEPS to develpe
1. Read paper to see how template generator works?
2. What is difference between contact and hotspot and interfaces?
3. update templates and pdb

1. Get the `template.zip` from github and unzip that
2. Get the `pdb.zip` from email
